# carbondoomsday

A [Django] web API for climate change data inspired by [no one giving a fuck].

[Django]: https://www.djangoproject.com/
[React.js]: https://facebook.github.io/react/
[no one giving a fuck]: http://titojankowski.com/no-one-gives-a-fck-about-climate-change/

This is a community driven project which aims to bring all levels of
contributor to engage in providing a reliable, [free] and feature packed web
API to allow front-end client creators consume climate change related data in
order to fuel a new wave of interesting and engaging visualisations and
interactive environments.

Climate change related data is largely free to access from various scientific
bodies but is distributed in inconvenient formats for web services to consume.
We want to scrape and gather what we can and expose it on the usual well known
RESTish web API interface.

Please see the [Swagger API documentation] to get started.
